      *	Cloud service providersâ€”e.g., what support they provide for scientific computin
      *	Information about Linux admin support
      * AER
      * Ramboll?
* Explain how to set up systems in the cloud
*	EPA vision for cloud and support for different cloud service providers
*	Ability for modeling centers to share data without having to ship hard drives
*	Data security, especially data being backed up
*	GitHub walkthrough/updates
*	Compare local security requirements/approaches (e.g., requirement to have a jump box)
*	Other modeling systems and tools: Blue Sky, MOVES, AMET
